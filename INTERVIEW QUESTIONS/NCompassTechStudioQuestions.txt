ROUND 2 WAS TECHNICAL ROUND 
1.  WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY DYNAMIC SCHEMA IN MONGODB ? 
ANS.    In MongoDB, a dynamic schema allows you to store documents with different structures in the same collection. 
        Unlike relational databases such as PostgreSQL, where the schema is predefined and enforced, MongoDB’s schema is flexible, 
        allowing for different fields and data types within the same collection.

        Here’s an example of how to work with a dynamic schema in MongoDB:

        db.exampleCollection.insertOne({ name: "Alice", age: 25 });
        db.exampleCollection.insertOne({ name: "Bob", address: "123 Main St" });
        db.exampleCollection.insertOne({ name: "Charlie", age: 30, email: "charlie@example.com" });


2.  WHAT IS A COLLECTION OF DOCUMENTS IN MONGODB CALLED ? 
ANS.    A collection of documents in MongoDB is called a "collection."

        In MongoDB, a collection is analogous to a table in a relational database. It is a grouping of MongoDB documents, 
        and all documents within a collection can have different fields and data types. Collections do not enforce a schema, 
        which allows for flexible data models.  


3.  retrieve the employee name whose salary is greater than the average salary of their department in PostgreSQL ?
ANS.    SELECT e.name
        FROM employees e
        WHERE e.salary > (
            SELECT AVG(e2.salary)
            FROM employees e2
            WHERE e2.department_id = e.department_id
        );

        In this query:

        The subquery calculates the average salary for each department (AVG(e2.salary) WHERE e2.department_id = e.department_id).
        The main query selects the employee names (e.name) whose salary is greater than the average salary of their department.
